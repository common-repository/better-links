	<li><?php _e('Multiple destination link type allows you to split test your links and send traffic equally to any number of destinations.'); ?></li>
	<li><?php _e('Geographic destination link type lets you send visitors from any country in the world to their own URL. Great for country specific affiliate offers. There are numerous examples but here\'s one: e.g. Send visitors from the UK to Amazon UK affiliate link and US visitors to Amazon US affiliate link to cash in on previously wasted international traffic.'); ?></li>
	<li><?php _e('Save time inserting links with automatic keyword replacement. Any keyword you enter will replace with your Better Link across all of the content on your WordPress powered website.'); ?></li>
	<li><?php _e('Advanced tracking integrates with Google Analytics to help you see where your links are being clicked the most and where they are aren\'t being clicked. e.g. One article on your blog is getting 10,000 visitors per month but your affiliate link is only being clicked .2% of the time. You can then go back to your article and see where you can add more links or improve your call to action.'); ?></li>
