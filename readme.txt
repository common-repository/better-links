Easily create, manage and insert shortened Better Links that originate from your WordPress domain. Forget link shortening services - use Better Links.

== Description ==
<strong>Better Links</strong> is a fast and easy way to create and manage links from within your WordPress dashboard. To make it easy we let you create links from within a dedicated link manager and even create and insert links right from within your WordPress post editor.

Sure, seeing your links are being clicked is neat but wouldn't it be more useful to see <strong>where your links are being clicked</strong> (and where they aren't?)
